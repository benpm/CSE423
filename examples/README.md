# Examples
These are a few examples of intermediate outputs from our compiler. Currently the parse trees and abstract syntax trees (ASTs) are available. These will be updated as changes are made to the compiler.

## factorial.c
[Source](../test_files/factorial.c) | [Parse Tree](factorial_parse.txt) | [AST](factorial_ast.txt)

A simple factorial program.

## small.c
[Source](../test_files/small.c) | [Parse Tree](small_parse.txt) | [AST](small_ast.txt)

A small program that tests a few more features than basic.

## basic.c
[Source](../test_files/basic.c) | [Parse Tree](basic_parse.txt) | [AST](basic_ast.txt)

A minimal program.
